# Semantic Segmentation

This is one of the first projects I have done for a graduate course named "deep learning with applications in computer vision and audio processing". If I got back, I would make a lot of changes in the way I wrote this code. However, I'm still proud of it.

This paper helped me through understading the concepts behind neural networks used for segmentation application:

I have used the network architecture used in this paper:

I have used CamVid dataset for my project. Here are some links for the dataset:
